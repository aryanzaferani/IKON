Ikon App


Open ikon.xcworkspace not ikon.xcodeproj

This app is designed to be run on an iPhone 7 plus which is the device I own. Most other devices work
but the spacing may be off. THe app does not have good UI for iphone XSMAX and iphone XR. Please run on iphone 7 Plus sim

You may need to run a pod install in order to get all the files working

When the app is rendered for the first time the user has to give it permission to track location always.
If the user does not give this permission the app will crash.

Some changed I made in order to make the app more user friendly are the following.

Instead of showing the polylines in the map tab bar I show them in the user profile section.
This allows for multiple occurences at each resort.

I also changed the ratings of the resorts to display how many times you have been to the resort.
I thought any algorithm I used to rank the resorts would have biased implications.




I ended up using both Google Maps SDK and the Apple Maps just so I could expirement with both.

I am very happy with the way the app came out and I am contacting Ikon to see if I can publish the app 
for their users.
